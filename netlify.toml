  functions = "netlify/functions"

  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```
4. **Click "Commit changes"**

✅ **Checkpoint**: Your repository should now have 4 items:
- README.md
- netlify.toml
- index.html
- netlify/ (folder)

**Perfect! Move to Step 3.**

## 🌐 **STEP 3: Deploy to Netlify (10 minutes)**

### 3.1 - Connect GitHub to Netlify
1. **Go to**: https://app.netlify.com
2. **Sign up** (use "Sign up with GitHub" - easiest option)
3. **Authorize Netlify** to access your GitHub account

### 3.2 - Import Your Project
1. **Click "Add new site"** (big button in the center or top-right)
2. **Click "Import an existing project"**
3. **Click "Deploy with GitHub"**
4. **Authorize Netlify** if prompted
5. **Find and click** your `disability-simulator` repository

### 3.3 - Configure Deployment
You'll see deployment settings:
- **Branch to deploy**: `main` (already selected)
- **Build command**: Leave empty
- **Publish directory**: Leave empty or type `.`
- **Click "Deploy [your-repo-name]"**

### 3.4 - Wait for Deployment
You'll see a deployment progress screen:
- "Site deploy in progress" 
- Takes about 1-2 minutes
- When finished, you'll see **"Published"** with a green checkmark
- You'll see a URL like: `https://curious-biscuit-a1b2c3.netlify.app`

✅ **Checkpoint**: You see "Published" and a URL? Excellent! But **DON'T test it yet** - we need to add your API key first!

---

## 🔑 **STEP 4: Add Your API Key (5 minutes)**

**This is the most important step!** Your simulator won't work without this.

### 4.1 - Navigate to Environment Variables
1. From your Netlify dashboard, **click "Site configuration"** (left sidebar)
2. **Click "Environment variables"** (in the left menu)
3. **Click "Add a variable"** → **"Add a single variable"**

### 4.2 - Add Anthropic API Key
1. **Key**: Type exactly: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
2. **Values**: Paste your Anthropic API key
   - It looks like: `sk-ant-api03-...` (long string of characters)
   - Get it from: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
3. **Click "Create variable"**

### 4.3 - Trigger Rebuild
**CRITICAL STEP**: The site needs to rebuild with the new variable!

1. **Click "Deploys"** (in the top menu)
2. **Click "Trigger deploy"** (dropdown button)
3. **Select "Deploy site"**
4. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for rebuild to complete

✅ **Checkpoint**: Under Environment Variables, you should see `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` listed with a value that's hidden (shows as dots).

## 🧪 **STEP 5: Test Your Simulator (5 minutes)**

### 5.1 - Open Your Site
1. **Go to "Deploys"** tab
2. **Click on the green "Published"** link at the top
   - Or copy the URL shown (like `https://curious-biscuit-a1b2c3.netlify.app`)
3. **Paste it in a new browser tab**

### 5.2 - Test Basic Functionality
You should see the welcome screen with:
- Title: "Disability Awareness Patient Simulator"
- Learning objectives section
- "Begin Session" button

**Click "Begin Session"**

Wait 3-5 seconds. You should see:
- A patient introduction message appear
- Patient card with summary at top
- A conversation interface

### 5.3 - Test a Conversation
1. **Type in the message box**: "Hi, I'm a medical student learning about disability care"
2. **Click "Send"** or press Enter
3. **Wait 3-5 seconds** for the patient to respond
4. **You should get a thoughtful response** from the simulated patient

### 5.4 - Test Voice Mode (Optional)
**Best in Chrome or Safari!**

1. **Toggle "Voice Mode"** to ON
2. **Click "Start Listening"**
3. **Grant microphone permission** if prompted
4. **Say**: "What brings you to the clinic today?"
5. **Patient should respond** with audio

✅ **Checkpoint**: If conversation works, congratulations! Your simulator is live! 🎉

## 🎨 **STEP 6: Customize Your URL (2 minutes)**

Right now your URL is something like `curious-biscuit-a1b2c3.netlify.app`. Let's make it better!

1. **Go to**: Site configuration → Domain management
2. **Under "Domain settings"**, click **"Options"** → **"Edit site name"**
3. **Type a new name**: 
   - `disability-simulator`
   - `med-edu-disability`
   - `northwell-disability-sim`
   - (Must be unique across all of Netlify)
4. **Click "Save"**

Your new URL: `https://your-chosen-name.netlify.app`

✅ **Done!** This is your permanent, shareable link.

---

## 📊 **STEP 7: Monitor Usage (2 minutes)**

### Set Spending Limits (Important!)
1. **Go to**: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/limits
2. **Set Monthly Spending Limit**: $25 (for testing) or $100 (for full RCT)
3. **Set Email Alerts**: at 50% and 80% of limit

### Check Netlify Limits
Your Netlify free tier includes:
- ✅ 125,000 function calls/month (plenty!)
- ✅ 100GB bandwidth/month (more than enough)
- ✅ 300 build minutes/month (way more than needed)

You can check usage at: Site configuration → Usage

## ✅ **YOU'RE DONE! HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE:**

🎉 **A live, working disability awareness simulator**
🔗 **A professional URL to share**: `https://your-name.netlify.app`
🔒 **Secure API key** (hidden from users)
🎤 **Voice-enabled** (works in Chrome/Safari)
💰 **Cost**: ~$0.50-1.00 per user for your study

---

## 📱 **NEXT STEPS - SHARE IT!**

### For Pilot Testing (This Week):
1. **Share URL with 5-10 colleagues**
2. **Ask for feedback** on:
   - Educational value
   - Voice quality (is browser speech good enough?)
   - User experience
   - Any bugs or issues
3. **Monitor API costs** daily in Anthropic console

### Email Template for Testers:
```
Subject: Pilot Test - Disability Awareness Simulator

Hi [Name],

I'm developing an AI-powered patient simulator for disability awareness 
training and would love your feedback.

Please visit: https://your-simulator.netlify.app

Instructions:
1. Click "Begin Session"
2. Have a 10-15 minute conversation with the virtual patient
3. Try Voice Mode if you'd like (works best in Chrome)
4. Send me feedback on the educational value and user experience

This should take about 15-20 minutes total.

Thanks!
Dr. Landry
